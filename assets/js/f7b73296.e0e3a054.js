From building RAD tools for web applications in 2000 to managing Kubernetes clusters with 2 million pods today, the journey has been one of continuous learning, adaptation, and growth. This is my story of building platforms at scale, and the lessons I\'ve learned along the way.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The Journey Begins: 2000-2007\\n\\nI started my career in 2000 at Mainet System Inc. in Shanghai, fresh out of graduate school from Zhejiang University. The dot-com boom was in full swing, and enterprises were just beginning to understand the power of web-based applications.\\n\\nAs a Project Manager and Architect, I worked on building RAD (Rapid Application Development) tools that would help developers build web applications faster. We used Spring, Hibernate, and Struts\u2014technologies that were cutting-edge at the time. Our team developed web-based ERP products including CRM, HRM, and CMS systems for over 40 enterprise customers.\\n\\nOne of my proudest achievements during this period was building and scaling R&D teams across three cities\u2014Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Qingdao\u2014eventually growing to 50+ developers. I learned early on that great platforms aren\'t just about technology; they\'re about building great teams.\\n\\n## Joining eBay: The DevEx Revolution (2007-2012)\\n\\nIn 2007, I made a pivotal career move to eBay China. I was tasked with building the Platform Development Experience Tools team from the ground up. Our mission was simple but ambitious: improve productivity for eBay\'s 2,000+ developers.\\n\\nWe built Raptor IDE, optimized eBay\'s development environment, and created wizards for frontend, service, and database frameworks. The impact was immediate and measurable. What used to take developers days could now be done in hours. We also developed eBay APIs and SDKs for third-party developers, expanding the platform\'s reach beyond internal teams.\\n\\nThis experience taught me a fundamental lesson: **Developer Experience is Everything**. A platform is only as good as the experience it provides to its users. If developers struggle with your tools, they won\'t adopt them, no matter how technically sophisticated they are.\\n\\n## The Cloud Transformation: Three Generations (2012-2017)\\n\\nIn 2012, I took on a new challenge as Software Development Manager for Cloud at eBay\'s China Center of Excellence. This marked the beginning of my deep dive into cloud infrastructure.\\n\\nLeading a team of 20 engineers, we architected and delivered eBay\'s internal cloud platforms, covering both IaaS and PaaS. This was the era of private cloud, and we went through three distinct generations of infrastructure:\\n\\n### Generation 1: VMware\\nWe started with VMware-based virtualization. It worked, but provisioning a new environment took days, sometimes weeks. The manual processes were a bottleneck.\\n\\n### Generation 2: OpenStack\\nWe then built our own OpenStack-based cloud. I designed a MongoDB-based Configuration Management System (CMS) that became the backbone of our infrastructure. We also built Zebra, a fully automated provisioning system that reduced provisioning time from days to just 10 minutes.\\n\\nThis was a game-changer. Developers could now get environments on-demand, and our infrastructure team could focus on innovation rather than manual toil.\\n\\n### Generation 3: Kubernetes\\nBy 2015-2016, we saw the writing on the wall. Containers and Kubernetes were the future. We started planning our migration to what would become eBay\'s container platform\u2014Tess.\\n\\nDuring this period, I also drove eBay China\'s Innovation Program, and we won multiple Skunkworks awards. The lesson here: **Start Simple, Then Scale**. Each generation of our platform built on the lessons of the previous one.\\n\\n## Kubernetes at Scale: The Migration Years (2017-2023)\\n\\nIn 2017, I returned to San Jose to lead the Cloud App Lifecycle team. Our mission was massive: migrate 5,000+ applications from OpenStack to Kubernetes, with zero downtime.\\n\\nThis was platform engineering at its most challenging. We were running:\\n- Applications across multiple regions and 25 availability zones\\n- 100+ Kubernetes clusters\\n- 2 million+ pods in production\\n- 35,000+ deployments per week across 20,000+ app pools\\n\\n### Building the Platform\\n\\nWe developed an end-to-end CI/CD platform using Tekton pipelines. We built an auto-deployment platform that could handle the massive scale of eBay\'s deployments. And critically, we built a self-healing remediation system called LOM (Lifecycle Operations Manager) that used observability signals to detect and fix issues automatically.\\n\\n### The Regional Migration\\n\\nOne of the most challenging projects was the regional data center migration\u2014exiting PHX and launching RENO\u2014with zero downtime. This required meticulous planning, automation, and coordination across dozens of teams. The fact that we pulled it off without impacting customers remains one of my proudest achievements.\\n\\nThe key lesson: **Automate Everything You Can**. At this scale, manual processes don\'t work. Automation isn\'t just a nice-to-have; it\'s essential for survival.\\n\\n## Leading Cloud Fleet: The Present (2023-Present)\\n\\nIn 2023, I took on my current role as Software Development Manager for Cloud Fleet Management. This role has been about taking everything we learned and scaling it globally.\\n\\n### Global Expansion\\n\\nWe established engineering hubs in Europe and India, hiring 8+ engineers and building truly distributed teams. Managing global teams across time zones requires different skills than managing co-located teams, but the diversity of perspectives and round-the-clock coverage has been invaluable.\\n\\n### Innovation Programs\\n\\nWe participated in the DoJ and Jade programs, accelerating the stand-up of new availability zones and clusters. We\'ve expanded eBay\'s Kubernetes infrastructure to 3 regions, 25 AZs, and continue to scale.\\n\\n### AI-Powered Engineering\\n\\nPerhaps most exciting has been our exploration of AI in platform engineering. We\'ve built 6+ Claude-based hiring skills and piloted spec-driven development. AI isn\'t replacing engineers\u2014it\'s making us more productive and allowing us to focus on higher-level problems.\\n\\nThe lesson: **Embrace Change and Innovation**. The technologies that got us here won\'t get us where we need to go next.\\n\\n## Five Key Lessons from 20 Years\\n\\nLooking back, here are the most important lessons I\'ve learned:\\n\\n### 1. Developer Experience is Everything\\nYour platform\'s success depends on how well it serves developers. Invest in tools, documentation, and support. Make the easy things easy and the hard things possible.\\n\\n### 2. Start Simple, Then Scale\\nDon\'t over-engineer from day one. Build what you need now, but architect for future scale. Each iteration should be better than the last.\\n\\n### 3. Automate Everything You Can\\nAt scale, manual processes break down. Automation isn\'t just about efficiency\u2014it\'s about reliability and consistency.\\n\\n### 4. Embrace Change\\nThe technology landscape changes rapidly. What\'s cutting-edge today will be legacy tomorrow. Stay curious, keep learning, and don\'t be afraid to reinvent your platform when needed.\\n\\n### 5. Build Great Teams\\nTechnology is important, but people are more important. Hire well, mentor generously, and create an environment where engineers can do their best work. The best platforms are built by the best teams.\\n\\n## What\'s Next?\\n\\nAfter 20 years, I\'m more excited about platform engineering than ever. The next frontiers include:\\n\\n- **AI-Native Platforms**: How do we build platforms that leverage AI to self-optimize, self-heal, and even self-evolve?\\n- **Multi-Cloud Orchestration**: As organizations adopt multi-cloud strategies, the complexity of orchestration will increase. How do we abstract this complexity while maintaining flexibility?\\n- **Sustainability**: As platforms grow, so does their environmental impact. How do we build efficient, sustainable platforms that minimize waste?\\n- **Developer Productivity**: With AI assistance, what will developer workflows look like? How do platforms need to evolve to support AI-augmented development?\\n\\n## Closing Thoughts\\n\\nTwenty years ago, I couldn\'t have imagined managing Kubernetes clusters with 2 million pods. Twenty years from now, today\'s cutting-edge will seem quaint. That\'s what makes this field so exciting.\\n\\nTo those starting their careers in platform engineering: embrace the journey. Learn the fundamentals, stay curious, invest in people, and don\'t be afraid to reinvent yourself every few years. The platforms you build will enable thousands of developers to create amazing things.\\n\\nAnd that\'s what it\'s all about\u2014building the foundation that empowers others to build the future.\\n\\n---\\n\\n*What has your experience been with platform engineering?

Conclusion and Future Outlook\\n\\n### 6.1 Finance Project Development Data Summary\\n\\n**Project Basic Info**:\\n- **Start Time**: November 2025\\n- **Development Mode**: 100% Claude Code assisted\\n- **Code Repository**: https://github.com/austinxyz/finance\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n**Code Scale**:\\n- **Backend Code**: 15,748 lines (Java)\\n- **Frontend Code**: 25,131 lines (Vue/JavaScript/TypeScript, 33 components)\\n- **Database**: 25 tables, 11 migration scripts\\n- **Total Code**: Approximately 41,000 lines\\n\\n#### Development Efficiency Improvement\\n\\n**Total Time Investment** (estimate): Approximately 20 hours net development time\\n\\n**Time Distribution** (reference previous chapters):\\n- Requirements refinement and architecture design: ~30%\\n- Rapid iterative development (15-20 min/small feature): ~40%\\n- Testing and experience optimization: ~20%\\n- Documentation and deployment: ~10%\\n\\n**Key Insights**:\\n- \u2705 Repetitive work sees greatest efficiency improvement (CRUD, testing, doc sync)\\n- \u2705 Cross-layer implementation highly efficient (database + backend + frontend completed at once)\\n- \u26a0\ufe0f Complex business logic needs multiple iterations (like annual summary algorithm)\\n- \ud83c\udfaf **Overall efficiency improvement approximately 4-5x**\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 6.2 Core Advantages of Claude Code\\n\\nBased on Finance project practice, I\'ve summarized Claude Code\'s three core advantages:\\n\\n#### 1. Lowering Programming Barriers\\n\\n**Real Experience**:\\n- Reduced learning curve for unfamiliar technologies\\n- Stored procedure writing: Previously unfamiliar, Claude helped quickly implement complex aggregation logic\\n- Vue complex pages: Multi-level component interaction, state management, Claude generated initial version then human optimization\\n- Mobile optimization: Responsive design details, Claude applied Tailwind best practices\\n\\n**Conclusion**:\\n> **AI makes tech stack learning curves gentler, from \\"need months to learn\\" to \\"learn while doing\\"**\\n\\n#### 2. Accelerating Iteration Speed\\n\\n**Key Data**: Finance project iteration rhythm\\n- Average iteration cycle: 1-3 days/major feature module (asset & liability management, expense management)\\n- Typical single feature development: 15-20 minutes (small rapid steps)\\n- Continuous refactoring optimization: No clear Sprint boundaries, continuous improvement\\n\\n**Value of Rapid Iteration**:\\n- \u2705 Quickly validate ideas (avoid wasting time in wrong direction)\\n- \u2705 Maintain development enthusiasm (see progress, less likely to give up)\\n- \u2705 Discover problems early (won\'t find architecture defects only in late project stage)\\n\\n#### 3. Knowledge Inheritance & Standardization\\n\\n**CLAUDE.md as \\"Living Documentation\\"**\\n\\nProblems in traditional development:\\n- New members join: Need old employees to orally pass on project conventions\\n- Project pause then restart: Forgot original design decisions\\n- Inconsistent code styles: Everyone has their own habits\\n\\n**Claude Code Solution**:\\n- \u2705 CLAUDE.md forces AI to follow standards (high consistency)\\n- \u2705 New sessions auto-load standards (no human memorization needed)\\n- \u2705 Standards as code (version controllable, reviewable)\\n\\n**Conclusion**:\\n> **CLAUDE.md + Claude Code = Project\'s \\"permanent memory\\"**, even if humans forget, AI can help restore context\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 6.3 Current Limitations\\n\\nDespite Claude Code\'s power, encountered some limitations in actual use (detailed scenarios and solutions in previous chapters):\\n\\n#### 1. Context Management Challenges\\n- **Problem**: 200K token window easily exhausted in complex feature development, after 10-15 rounds of dialogue Claude starts \\"forgetting\\" early content\\n- **Response**: Regular `/clear + /catchup` reset, split large tasks, control CLAUDE.md size\\n\\n#### 2. Unpredictable Code Quality\\n- **Problem**: Same requirements may generate vastly different quality code (like verbose loops vs elegant Stream API)\\n- **Response**: In CLAUDE.md clearly state code style preferences, when quality poor directly request regeneration\\n\\n#### 3. Limited Understanding of Complex Business Logic\\n- **Problem**: AI excels at technical implementation but doesn\'t understand business meaning, need human review of key business rules\\n- **Conclusion**: AI is excellent coding assistant, but not domain expert, complex business logic still needs human design\\n\\n#### 4. Impact of Project Scale\\n- **Observation**: Finance project approximately 40,000 lines code, Claude Code performs excellently\\n- **Recommendation**: Medium projects (100K-1M lines) need carefully designed CLAUDE.md to maintain global understanding\\n---\\n\\n### 6.4 Recommendations for Readers\\n\\nBased on Finance project practical experience, I offer following recommendations for different roles:\\n\\n#### For Individual Developers\\n\\n**Start using Claude Code immediately, but:**\\n1. \u2705 **Start with small projects** - Don\'t use directly in work projects, practice in side projects first\\n2. \u2705 **Build CLAUDE.md** - Create from day one, record every pitfall\\n3. \u2705 **Use Planning Mode** - Large features (>3 files) must plan first\\n4. \u26a0\ufe0f **Maintain skepticism** - Code review AI output, don\'t blindly trust\\n5. \ud83c\udfaf **Regularly clean context** - `/clear + /catchup` is your friend\\n\\n#### For Technical Teams\\n\\n**Evaluate then introduce cautiously, recommend:**\\n1. \u2705 **Pilot Projects** - Choose 1-2 non-core projects for 3-month trial\\n2. \u2705 **Establish Standards** - Unified CLAUDE.md is essential\\n3. \u2705 **Build Skills Library** - Encapsulate team common operations (deployment, testing, code checking)\\n4. \u26a0\ufe0f **Security Review** - Setup Hooks to enforce code review and testing\\n5. \ud83c\udfaf **Training & Sharing** - Regularly share AI usage experience and pitfall records\\n\\n#### For Learners\\n\\n**Use AI as learning tool, not replacement:**\\n1. \u2705 **Learning Path** - Manually write basic code (CRUD) first, then let AI assist advanced features\\n2. \u2705 **Comparative Learning** - See AI\'s implementation, compare with your own (learn new techniques)\\n3. \u2705 **Understanding First** - When encountering code you don\'t understand, let AI explain (rather than direct copy)\\n4. \u26a0\ufe0f **Avoid Dependency** - Hand-write at least one algorithm weekly (maintain basic skills)\\n5. \ud83c\udfaf **Project-Driven** - Use AI for real projects (rather than just tutorial exercises)\\n\\n#### For Enterprise Decision-Makers\\n\\n**AI-assisted programming is trend, but needs systematic introduction:**\\n1. \u2705 **ROI Assessment** - Calculate actual efficiency improvement after pilot (don\'t only look at promotion)\\n2. \u2705 **Security & Compliance** - Consult legal and security teams (code ownership, data privacy)\\n3. \u2705 **Training Investment** - AI tools aren\'t \\"buy and use\\", teams need learning\\n4. \u26a0\ufe0f **Progressive Migration** - From pilot to promotion needs 6-12 months\\n5. \ud83c\udfaf **Cultural Transformation** - Encourage experimentation and sharing (rather than penalizing AI usage mistakes)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Closing Remarks\\n\\nThe Finance project transformed from an idea into a fully-featured, deployable full-stack application, with Claude Code playing the role of \\"super assistant\\"\u2014it\'s not magic (can\'t replace human thinking and decision-making), but it greatly amplified individual developer capabilities.\\n\\n**My greatest gain wasn\'t completing this project, but experiencing the shift in programming paradigm**:\\n\\nFrom \\"I write code\\" to \\"I design, AI implements, I review,\\" from \\"solitary coder\\" to \\"architect collaborating with AI.\\"\\n\\nAs Martin Fowler said:\\n> \\"AI won\'t replace programmers, but will redefine what makes an \'excellent programmer.\' Future excellent programmers won\'t be those who write code fastest, but those best at leveraging AI, best at designing systems, and best at controlling quality.\\"\\n\\n**This article is just the beginning.** As Claude Code continues evolving and my understanding of AI-assisted programming deepens, I\'ll continue updating this practical guide.\\n\\nIf you\'re also exploring AI-assisted programming, welcome to exchange ideas with me (GitHub Issues or email).

Open Source Project Contribution**\\n- \u2705 CLAUDE.md can serve as contributor guide\\n- \u2705 AI helps new contributors understand codebase\\n- \u2705 AI generates PRs conforming to project standards\\n\\n**Recommended Practice**: In CLAUDE.md explain development workflow, common pitfalls, code standards, helping contributors get started quickly\\n\\n#### Unsuitable Team Scenarios\\n\\n**1. Large Enterprises (100+ engineers)**\\n- \u274c CLAUDE.md hard to cover all teams\' special needs\\n- \u274c Complex code review process (needs multi-level approval)\\n- \u26a0\ufe0f Security and compliance issues (AI accessing sensitive code)\\n\\n**Solution** (Shrivu\'s enterprise practice):\\n- Each product line maintains its own CLAUDE.md (inheriting company-level standards)\\n- Use Claude Code GHA (GitHub Actions) rather than local CLI (better auditing)\\n- Limit AI access scope (can only access specific codebases)\\n\\n**2. Highly Regulated Industries (Finance, Healthcare)**\\n- \u274c AI-generated code needs strict compliance review\\n- \u274c Code ownership and liability issues (who\'s responsible for AI-written bugs?)\\n- \u26a0\ufe0f Data privacy issues (code may contain sensitive info)\\n\\n**Recommendations**:\\n- Only use AI in non-core, non-sensitive modules\\n- All AI-generated code must have human review + legal/compliance approval\\n- Use privately deployed models (like Claude for Enterprise)\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 5.4 Common Mistakes & Efficiency Traps\\n\\nDuring Finance project development, I made some mistakes that significantly reduced Claude Code efficiency. These lessons worth sharing:\\n\\n#### Mistake 1: Key Constraints Not Codified in CLAUDE.md or Skills\\n\\n**Problem Manifestation**:\\n- Claude keeps making same mistakes (like using wrong database connection method)\\n- Every session must repeatedly emphasize same rules\\n- Waste lots of tokens correcting errors\\n\\n**Real Cases**:\\n- First 3 sessions, Claude always used `mvn` instead of `./mvnw`\\n- Repeatedly forgot to use `TimeService.getCurrentTimestamp()` causing timezone issues\\n- Database operations always wrote raw SQL instead of using `/mysql-exec` skill\\n\\n**Solution**:\\n- \u2705 Write recurring rules into CLAUDE.md \\"Critical Rules\\"\\n- \u2705 Encapsulate common operations as Skills (like `/setup-java`, `/mysql-exec`)\\n- \u2705 Use Hooks to enforce key constraints\\n\\n#### Mistake 2: Too Much CLAUDE.md Content Causing Token Exhaustion\\n\\n**Problem Manifestation**:\\n- Each session quickly prompts token insufficiency\\n- Need frequent `/clear` to restart\\n- Wait time for summary generation too long (1-2 minutes)\\n\\n**Real Cases**:\\n- Initial CLAUDE.md contained lots of detailed example code (20KB+)\\n- Each read consumed 15K+ tokens\\n- 5-6 rounds of dialogue then needed session restart\\n\\n**Solution**:\\n- \u2705 Delete example code, keep only rules and principles\\n- \u2705 Move detailed docs to external files (like `docs/api-design.md`)\\n- \u2705 Keep CLAUDE.md within 5-10KB\\n- \u2705 Use \\"ALWAYS/NEVER\\" format concise rules\\n\\n#### Mistake 3: Too Large Requirement Steps Causing Frequent Database Changes\\n\\n**Problem Manifestation**:\\n- Late-stage frequent database table structure modifications\\n- Each modification affects massive frontend/backend changes\\n- Data migration scripts increasingly complex\\n\\n**Real Cases**:\\n- Version 1 expense management didn\'t consider multi-currency, later addition modified 5 tables\\n- Led to: 10+ APIs need modification, 8 frontend components need updates, 3 stored procedures need rewrite\\n- Data migration script: 300+ lines complex SQL (including data conversion and validation logic)\\n- Another example: Claude initially designed too many tables and fields (\\"might be useful\\" redundant design)\\n- Later cleanup work: Delete 4 unused tables, 20+ redundant fields, took 2 days\\n\\n**Solution**:\\n- \u2705 Use Planning Mode to fully design data model\\n- \u2705 Only implement one small feature at a time, fully test before expanding\\n- \u2705 Important fields (like currency) consider in version 1\\n- \u2705 Reference existing module data model design\\n\\n#### Mistake 4: Only Testing Functionality Not Reviewing Implementation Causing Technical Debt\\n\\n**Problem Manifestation**:\\n- Surface functionality same, but backend implementation completely different\\n- Late-stage refactoring discovered lots of inconsistent code\\n- Hard to maintain and extend\\n\\n**Real Cases**:\\n- Asset analysis and expense analysis pages look similar\\n- But backend: One uses stored procedure, one uses Java Service layer\\n- Data retrieval: One real-time query, one cached results\\n- Refactoring found can\'t unify optimization\\n\\n**Solution**:\\n- \u2705 After each feature complete, briefly review implementation code\\n- \u2705 Check if follows existing architecture patterns\\n- \u2705 Similar features should use similar implementation approaches\\n- \u2705 In CLAUDE.md clearly state architecture decisions (like \\"aggregation uses stored procedures\\")\\n\\n#### Mistake 5: Improper .gitignore Configuration Causing Sensitive Info Leaks\\n\\n**Problem Manifestation**:\\n- Sensitive info (database passwords, API keys) committed to Git\\n- Claude exposes sensitive info in commit messages\\n- Need git filter-branch to clean history (complex and dangerous)\\n\\n**Real Cases**:\\n- Initially didn\'t configure `.gitignore`, `backend/.env` file committed\\n- File contained: Database password, email server credentials\\n- Claude-generated commit message: \\"Add database config with password mysql123\\"\\n- After discovery needed: Delete historical commits, regenerate keys, force push\\n\\n**Solution**:\\n- \u2705 Configure `.gitignore` immediately at project initialization\\n- \u2705 In CLAUDE.md clearly mark: \\"NEVER commit backend/.env\\"\\n- \u2705 Use pre-commit hook to check sensitive files\\n- \u2705 Regularly review commit messages, avoid exposing sensitive info\\n- \u2705 Use `/git-commit-push` skill to auto-generate commit messages (can manually review)\\n\\n**Core Lesson**:\\n> **Claude Code efficiency highly depends on good project management habits. Lazy early preparation will be repaid double in later stages.**"},{"id":"/2025/12/18/claude-code-methodology-evolution","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/blog/2025/12/18/claude-code-methodology-evolution","source":"@site/blog/2025-12-18-claude-code-methodology-evolution.md","title":"[4/6] Claude Code: Evolution of Development Methodology","description":"How Claude Code is evolving software development methodologies and practices.","date":"2025-12-18T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"ai","permalink":"/blogs/blog/tags/ai"},{"inline":true,"label":"claude-code","permalink":"/blogs/blog/tags/claude-code"},{"inline":true,"label":"methodology","permalink":"/blogs/blog/tags/methodology"},{"inline":true,"label":"software-engineering","permalink":"/blogs/blog/tags/software-engineering"}],"readingTime":5.21,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Austin Xu","title":"Cloud Platform Engineering Leader @ eBay","url":"https://github.com/austinxyz","email":"austin.xyz@gmail.com","socials":{"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/austin-yanzhao-xu-6301ab6","github":"https://github.com/austinxyz"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/austinxyz.png","key":"austin","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"[4/6] Claude Code: Evolution of Development Methodology","date":"2025-12-18T00:00:00.000Z","authors":["austin"],"tags":["ai","claude-code","methodology","software-engineering"],"description":"How Claude Code is evolving software development methodologies and practices."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"[5/6] Claude Code: Use Cases and Limitations","permalink":"/blogs/blog/2025/12/19/claude-code-use-cases-and-limitations"},"nextItem":{"title":"[3/6] Claude Code: Development Walkthrough","permalink":"/blogs/blog/2025/12/17/claude-code-development-walkthrough"}},"content":"This is part 4 of a 6-part series on Claude Code.\\n\\n## 4.

Create Spring Boot project (Spring Initializr)\\n2. Configure Maven/Gradle\\n3. Create package structure (controller/service/repository)\\n4. Configure database connection (application.yml)\\n5. Create Vue project (vue create)\\n6. Configure routing, state management, API client\\n7. Setup Dockerfile and k8s configs\\n```\\n\\n**Claude Code Approach (Recommended)** (20 minutes):\\n```bash\\n$ claude\\n\\nYou: Create a full-stack financial management system, referencing my previous match project (tennis match management) tech stack and directory structure.\\n\\n**First core feature**: Asset & liability management\\n- Asset and liability type management\\n- Time-series data model: Record historical changes for each asset/liability\\n- Basic CRUD operations and list displays\\n```\\n\\n**Why This Approach**:\\n1. **Reference Existing Project**: Fix tech stack, avoid AI choosing inconsistent frameworks\\n2. **Clear Directory Architecture**: Ensure clean project structure, easy to expand\\n3. **Focus on Core Features**: Complete most important asset & liability management first, validate architecture\\n4. **Progressive Expansion**: Clear feature iteration sequence (management \u2192 analysis \u2192 extension)\\n\\n**Real Results**:\\n- \u2705 Generated complete directory structure\\n- \u2705 Configured Spring Security, JPA, CORS\\n- \u2705 Created basic entities (User, Family) and corresponding CRUD\\n- \u2705 Frontend routing, Axios configuration, Tailwind theme\\n- \u274c Needed manual adjustment of database connection string (AI used defaults)\\n\\n**Key Learnings**:\\n1. **Let AI generate 80%, manually refine 20%** - Initialization phase, AI can quickly build standard architecture\\n2. **Provide clear tech stack** - Vague requirements lead AI to choose outdated or mismatched technologies\\n3. **Generate first, adjust later** - Don\'t expect perfection first time, rapid iteration is more efficient\\n\\n#### Optimization Practice: The Inception of CLAUDE.md\\n\\nAfter initialization, I created the first version of CLAUDE.md:\\n\\n```markdown\\n# Finance App - Claude Code Guide\\n\\n## Stack\\nJava 17 + Spring Boot 3.2 + Vue 3 + MySQL 8.0\\n\\n## Critical Rules\\n- **ALWAYS use Maven wrapper** - `./mvnw` instead of `mvn`\\n- **NEVER commit backend/.env** - Contains DB credentials\\n```\\n\\n**Why Write CLAUDE.md So Early?**\\n- \u2705 Prevent AI from \\"forgetting\\" tech stack in subsequent sessions\\n- \u2705 Record problems encountered on day one (e.g., mvn vs ./mvnw)\\n- \u2705 Lay foundation for future `/clear + /catchup` workflow\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3.2 Requirements Phase: From Vague Ideas to Precise Specs\\n\\n#### My Requirements Workflow (Prevent AI Over-Design)\\n\\n**Step 1: High-Level Requirements**\\n\\n```bash\\nYou: I want to implement expense management functionality, don\'t implement yet, help me break down requirements.\\n\\n**Core requirements**:\\n- Expense category management (major + subcategories)\\n- Monthly batch entry\\n- Multi-currency support\\n\\n**I particularly care about**:\\n- Data entry efficiency (complete all subcategories in one form)\\n- Historical data reference (show last 3 months)\\n```\\n\\n**Step 2: Review AI\'s Requirements Breakdown**\\n\\nClaude returns detailed requirement list, usually has **over-design** tendencies:\\n\\n```\\nClaude: Here\'s the requirements breakdown:\\n1. Expense category management\\n   - Major category CRUD\\n   - Subcategory CRUD\\n   - Category hierarchy management (major \u2192 subcategory)\\n2. Monthly entry\\n   - Batch entry form\\n   - Historical data display (last 3 months)\\n   - Auto-save draft \u274c (over-design)\\n   - Template function (copy last month) \u274c (not needed yet)\\n3. Multi-currency\\n   - 7 currency support\\n   - Real-time exchange rate retrieval\\n   - Exchange rate history \u274c (phase 2)\\n4. Data validation\\n   - Uniqueness constraints\\n   - Amount range validation \u274c (unnecessary)\\n...\\n```\\n\\n**My Response**:\\n```\\nYou: Requirements 3.3 (exchange rate history), 2.2 (auto-save draft), 2.3 (template function), 4.2 (amount range validation) - don\'t do these yet.\\nKeep core features: category management, batch entry, multi-currency, basic validation.\\n```\\n\\n**Why This Approach**:\\n- \u2705 **Prevent Scope Creep**: AI tends to add \\"useful but non-essential\\" features\\n- \u2705 **Rapid Iteration**: Do minimum viable version (MVP) first, expand based on actual needs\\n- \u2705 **Reduce Complexity**: Avoid first version introducing too many features leading to prolonged implementation\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3.3 Design Phase: Architecture Decisions & AI Boundaries\\n\\nAfter requirements are clear, enter design phase. This is a **human-led, AI-assisted** phase.\\n\\n#### Planning Mode: Systematic Design Process\\n\\nFor complex features (like expense management\'s three-level drill-down analysis), I use Planning Mode for systematic design:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ claude --plan\\n\\nYou: Implement three-level drill-down for expense analysis, provide detailed design including:\\n\\n1. **Data Model Design**\\n2. **Backend API Design**\\n3. **Frontend UI Mock**\\n4. **Test Case Design**\\n\\n**Feature requirements**:\\n- Pie chart showing major category proportions\\n- Click major category \u2192 subcategory pie chart for that category\\n- Click subcategory \u2192 monthly bar chart for that subcategory\\n\\n**UI Reference**:\\n- First feature: Start simple, pure white background + basic charts\\n- Subsequent features: Reference implemented AssetAnalysisView.vue style\\n  (ensure consistent user experience)\\n```\\n\\n**Claude\'s Generated Plan** (plan.md):\\n\\n```markdown\\n# Expense Analysis Three-Level Drill-Down - Design Plan\\n\\n## 1. Data Model Design\\n- Use existing tables, no new fields needed\\n- Key field review (amount_usd, period, is_deleted)\\n\\n## 2.

My two practical methods:\\n\\n**Method 1: Distill Architecture Principles from Existing System**\\n\\nAfter the first feature stabilizes, I summarize architecture design principles and write them into CLAUDE.md:\\n\\n```markdown\\n## Architecture Principles\\n\\n**Time-Series Data**:\\n- Asset/Liability: NEVER update existing records, always INSERT new ones\\n- Reason: Historical tracking requirement\\n\\n**Multi-Currency**:\\n- Store original currency + converted USD amount\\n- Use ExchangeRateService for all conversions\\n- Reason: Audit trail + performance\\n\\n...\\n```\\n\\n**Why Important**:\\n- New features automatically follow established principles\\n- Prevent AI from using different architectures for similar features\\n- Reduce long-term refactoring costs\\n\\n**Method 2: Small Feature Experiments + Multi-Option Comparison**\\n\\nFor uncertain architecture decisions (like which layer for complex logic), I ask Claude for multiple options:\\n\\n```bash\\nYou: Annual financial summary logic is complex (cross-table joins, currency conversion, time range filtering), give me 3 implementation approaches:\\n1. MySQL stored procedure\\n2. Java Service layer calculation\\n3. Frontend real-time calculation\\n\\nFor each approach, analyze performance, maintainability, testing difficulty.\\n\\nDon\'t implement yet, just compare approaches.\\n```\\n\\nClaude\'s response:\\n\\n| Approach | Performance | Maintainability | Testing Difficulty | Use Case |\\n|----------|------------|----------------|-------------------|----------|\\n| Stored Procedure | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 | \u2b50\u2b50 | \u2b50\u2b50 | Large data, frequent queries |\\n| Java Service | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 | Complex logic, need unit tests |\\n| Frontend Calculation | \u2b50 | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 | Small data, real-time interaction |\\n\\n**My Decision Process**:\\n1. Choose approach 1 (stored procedure) + approach 2 (Java Service) to implement one small feature each\\n2. Compare actual results:\\n   - Stored procedure: Query time from 3s down to 0.5s\\n   - Java Service: High unit test coverage, but slow\\n3. **Final Approach**: Hybrid\\n   - Cross-table aggregation \u2192 Stored procedure\\n   - Currency conversion + business logic \u2192 Java Service\\n   - Frontend only for display\\n\\n**Codify Decision in CLAUDE.md**:\\n```markdown\\n**Complex Aggregation**:\\n- Use MySQL stored procedures for cross-table aggregation\\n- Java Service layer handles business logic + currency conversion\\n- Frontend: presentation only\\n```\\n\\n**Why This Approach**:\\n- \u2705 Small feature experiment low cost (1-2 hours)\\n- \u2705 Actual comparison more reliable than theoretical analysis\\n- \u2705 Once established, subsequent features stay consistent\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n### 3.4 Implementation Phase: Efficient Collaboration & Automation\\n\\nThis is where Claude Code delivers the most value.\\n\\n#### Plan-based Cross-Layer Implementation\\n\\nSince I\'ve already made a Plan in the design phase (including data model, API, UI Mock), implementation necessarily involves cross-layer changes. Claude Code\'s advantages:\\n- \u2705 **Code Standards**: Generated code follows project conventions\\n- \u2705 **Cross-Layer Consistency**: API return format matches frontend expectations\\n- \u2705 **Automatic Integration**: Most cases run without manual adjustments\\n\\n**Task**: Add \\"expense budget\\" feature (Plan design already complete)\\n\\n**Plan Output** (determined in design phase):\\n- Database: `expense_budgets` table\\n- Backend: BudgetService, BudgetController\\n- Frontend: BudgetManagementView.vue\\n- API: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/budgets\\n\\n**Implementation Order** (my standard process):\\n1. **Database First**: Create table and migration script\\n2. **Backend Implementation**: Service \u2192 Controller \u2192 Unit tests\\n3. **Frontend Implementation**: Component \u2192 API calls \u2192 Integration tests\\n\\n**Traditional Approach**:\\n1. Write backend (1-2 hours)\\n2. Test API (30 minutes)\\n3. Write frontend (1-2 hours)\\n4. Integration (30 minutes)\\n5. Write database script (30 minutes)\\n\\n**Claude Code Implementation Process** (following my standard order):\\n\\n**Step 1: Database**\\n- Create migration script, execute `/mysql-exec` to create table\\n- \u2705 Database ready\\n\\n**Step 2: Backend Implementation + Tests**\\n- Generate Entity, Repository, Service, Controller\\n- Write unit tests and run `./mvnw test`\\n- Auto-fix issues found in tests\\n- \u2705 Tests passing\\n\\n**Step 3: Frontend Implementation**\\n- Create Vue component, reference existing style\\n- API calls automatically match backend format\\n- \u2705 Frontend-backend integration successful\\n\\n**Why This Order Is Efficient**:\\n1. **Database First**: Avoid backend multiple table structure changes\\n2. **Backend Fully Tested**: Ensure logic correct before frontend\\n3. **Frontend Direct Integration**: API already validated, frontend implementation fast\\n\\n**Key Observation**:\\n- Claude will **autonomously run tests** and fix errors (prerequisite: project has tests)\\n- Good cross-layer consistency: API return format automatically matches frontend expectations\\n- Follows existing code style: Frontend references ExpenseManagementView.vue, style consistent\\n\\n#### The Power of Skills - Automated Workflows\\n\\n**Problem**: Every database change requires manual operations (write script, copy password, execute, check)\\n\\n**Solution**: Create `/mysql-exec` Skill, automatically load credentials and execute SQL\\n\\n**Effect**:\\n```bash\\n# Before: 5 manual steps\\n# Now: 1 command\\n$ /mysql-exec database/add_budget_table.sql\\n\u2713 Executed successfully\\n```\\n\\n**Skills vs. Manual Commands Comparison**:\\n| Scenario | Manual Commands | Skill |\\n|----------|----------------|-------|\\n| Time Cost | 2-3 minutes | 10 seconds |\\n| Password Leak Risk | High (history) | Low (encapsulated) |\\n| Repeatability | Need to remember commands | Consistency guaranteed |\\n| AI Usability | Need guidance | Auto-invoked |\\n\\n**My Other Skills**:\\n- `/setup-java` - Configure Java 17 + load env variables (must use every session)\\n- `/git-commit-push` - Atomic stage, commit, push (follows Conventional Commits)\\n- `/docker-build-push` - Multi-architecture image build (amd64/arm64)\\n\\n#### CLAUDE.md Evolution in Implementation Phase\\n\\nAs development deepens, CLAUDE.md added implementation-level constraints:\\n\\n```markdown\\n## Backend Development\\n\\n**NEVER modify JPA entities without checking existing records**\\n**ALWAYS use TimeService.getCurrentTimestamp()**\\n\\n## Frontend Development\\n\\n**ALWAYS use Composition API** - No Options API\\n**NEVER hardcode colors** - Use CSS variables\\n\\n...\\n```\\n\\n**Why These Rules Matter?**\\n- `TimeService` rule: Prevented a serious bug (timezone inconsistency caused data chaos)\\n- JPA rule: Prevent AI from directly modifying entities causing data loss\\n- Composition API: Maintain code style consistency\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3.5 Testing Phase: Iterative Quality Assurance\\n\\n**My Testing Workflow**:\\n\\n1. **Unit Tests**: Part of implementation phase\\n   - After backend Service layer code generated, immediately generate unit tests\\n   - Run `./mvnw test` to verify logic correctness\\n\\n2. **Manual Usage Testing**: Discover issues and improve experience\\n   - After completing multi-layer implementation (database + backend + frontend), use it yourself first\\n   - Find bugs \u2192 Fix \u2192 Test again\\n   - No bugs \u2192 Try improving user experience \u2192 Back to design and implementation\\n\\n3. **Multiple Iterations**: Until feature solidifies\\n   - Repeat \\"use \u2192 find issues \u2192 improve\\" cycle\\n   - Until feature is stable, experience satisfactory\\n\\n4. **Integration Testing**: Final check before commit\\n   - After feature solidifies, generate integration test cases\\n   - Ensure end-to-end workflow correct\\n   - **Only commit code when all integration tests pass**\\n\\nThis approach differs from traditional TDD (write tests first then code), better suited for rapid iteration mode in AI-assisted development.\\n\\n#### Auto-Generated Unit Tests\\n\\n**Task**: Write unit tests for `ExchangeRateService`\\n\\nClaude automatically generates test code, covering main scenarios (caching, conversion, batch operations, exception handling)\\n\\n**Results**:\\n- \u2705 Coverage 85%+\\n- \u2705 Found a bug: Negative amount not validated\\n- \u274c External API mock too complex, needed manual simplification\\n\\n#### Integration Testing & Hook Validation\\n\\n**Challenge**: Prevent AI from committing code when tests fail\\n\\n**Solution**: Create Pre-Commit Hook (`.claude/hooks/pre-tool-use.sh`), force test validation before commit\\n\\n**Value of Hooks**:\\n- \u2705 **Forced Validation** - AI cannot skip tests\\n- \u2705 **Self-Correction** - AI reads hook output and fixes issues\\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **Don\'t Overuse** - Too many hooks confuse AI\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3.6 Deployment Phase: Docker Containerization\\n\\nMy current deployment strategy:\\n- Docker image build (backend + frontend)\\n- Docker Compose local orchestration\\n- GitHub Actions auto-build and push to Docker Hub\\n\\n(Kubernetes deployment not yet implemented, planned for future)\\n\\n#### Docker Containerization\\n\\nClaude generated complete Docker configuration:\\n- **Backend Dockerfile**: Multi-stage build (Maven build + JRE runtime)\\n- **Frontend Dockerfile**: Vue build + Nginx serving\\n- **docker-compose.yml**: Complete orchestration of MySQL + backend + frontend\\n\\n**Evaluation**:\\n- \u2705 Multi-stage build reduces image size\\n- \u2705 Convenient for local development\\n- \u2705 Clear environment variable management\\n\\n#### GitHub Actions Auto-Build\\n\\nClaude generated complete GitHub Actions workflow, implementing:\\n- Push to master: Test \u2192 Build \u2192 Push to Docker Hub\\n- Pull Request: Run tests only\\n\\n**Real Usage Effect**:\\n- \u2705 Complete automated CI/CD workflow\\n- \u2705 Push both latest and commit SHA tags simultaneously\\n\\n#### /docker-build-push Skill\\n\\nTo simplify local builds, created `/docker-build-push` Skill supporting multi-architecture image build (amd64/arm64)\\n\\n**Effect**:\\n```bash\\n# Before: Multiple complex commands\\n# Now: One command completes\\n$ /docker-build-push\\n\u2713 Building backend (amd64, arm64)...\\n\u2713 Building frontend (amd64, arm64)...\\n\u2713 Pushed to Docker Hub\\n```"},{"id":"/2025/12/16/claude-code-overview","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/blog/2025/12/16/claude-code-overview","source":"@site/blog/2025-12-16-claude-code-overview.md","title":"[2/6]

\u2705 **Advantage**: Complete CLI autonomy, extremely efficient once accustomed, highly customizable\\n- \u2705 **Advantage**: Skills and Hooks build powerful workflows (like `/mysql-exec`, `/git-commit-push`)\\n- \u274c **Disadvantage**: Initially uncomfortable with pure command-line interface, lacks visual error hints\\n- **Suitable for**: Developers comfortable with command line, projects requiring high automation\\n\\n**Cline (VS Code Integration)**:\\n- \u2705 **Advantage**: User-friendly interface, intuitive error hints, seamless IDE integration\\n- \u2705 **Advantage**: Supports MCP, can connect external tools and data sources\\n- \u274c **Disadvantage**: Weaker customization than Claude Code, dependent on VS Code\\n- **Suitable for**: Developers accustomed to IDEs, value visual feedback\\n\\n**Cursor**:\\n- \u2705 **Advantage**: Out-of-the-box, lowest learning cost, excellent UI design\\n- \u274c **Disadvantage**: Weaker programmability, difficult to build

Cursor (UI friendly, out-of-the-box)\\n- **Enterprise projects/custom needs** \u2192 Claude Code (programmable, auditable, deep automation)\\n- **Team collaboration/need visualization** \u2192 Cline (VS Code integration, user-friendly interface)\\n- **Pure code completion** \u2192 GitHub Copilot (lightweight, integrated in editor)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2.4 Why Choose Claude Code\\n\\nAmong many AI programming tools, I ultimately chose Claude Code as the primary tool for the Finance project, for the following core reasons:\\n\\n**1. Complete CLI Autonomy**\\n\\nClaude Code can not only generate code, but also:\\n- Execute bash commands (run tests, build projects, start services)\\n- Manage git (stage, commit, push, create branches)\\n- Operate databases (through Skills encapsulating MySQL operations)\\n- Build and deploy (Docker images, Kubernetes configs)\\n\\n**Real Case**:\\n```bash\\nYou: Add expense budget feature, including backend API, frontend page, database migration\\n\\nClaude:\\n1. [Create database migration script]\\n2. [Execute /mysql-exec database/add_budget_table.sql]\\n3. [Generate ExpenseBudget.java, BudgetService.java, BudgetController.java]\\n4. [Run ./mvnw test to verify backend]\\n5. [Create BudgetManagementView.vue]\\n6. [Run npm run build to verify frontend]\\n7. [Execute /git-commit-push \\"feat: add expense budget management\\"]\\n\\nDone! Feature complete and pushed to GitHub.\\n```\\n\\n**2. Powerful Context Understanding**\\n\\n- **200K token window** (Sonnet 4): Can \\"see\\" the entire Finance project\\n- **Smart Context Selection**: Automatically reads relevant files (via `@mentions` in CLAUDE.md)\\n- **Session Memory**: Maintains context consistency across multiple requests\\n\\n**Real Data**:\\n- Finance project has 127 Java files and 33 Vue components\\n- Claude Code can understand cross-layer dependencies (e.g., which backend API frontend calls, database table structure)\\n- Generated code maintains naming and architecture consistency (referencing design principles in CLAUDE.md)\\n\\n**3. Programmability (Skills & Hooks)**\\n\\nEncapsulate complex operations through Skills, control AI behavior through Hooks.\\n\\n**My Skills Examples**:\\n- `/setup-java`: Configure Java 17 environment + load database credentials\\n- `/mysql-exec`: Execute SQL files/queries, automatically read `.env` credentials\\n- `/git-commit-push`: Stage \u2192 Commit (Conventional Commits) \u2192 Push\\n- `/docker-build-push`: Multi-architecture image build (amd64/arm64)\\n\\n**Hooks Example** (prevent AI from committing when tests fail):\\n```bash\\n# .claude/hooks/pre-tool-use.sh\\nif [[ \\"$TOOL_NAME\\" == \\"Bash\\" ]] && [[ \\"$COMMAND\\" =~ \\"git commit\\" ]]; then\\n  if [ ! -f /tmp/tests-passed ]; then\\n    echo \\"\u274c Tests have not passed. Run tests first.\\"\\n    exit 1\\n  fi\\nfi\\n```\\n\\n**4. Security and Controllability**\\n\\n- **Permission Management**: Configure which commands AI can execute (e.g., `rm -rf`)\\n- **Hook Interception**: Validate before AI executes operations (e.g., must run tests before commit)\\n- **Audit Logs**: All operations recorded in `.claude/logs/`\\n- **Sandbox Mode**: Test AI behavior in isolated environment\\n\\n**Real Results**:\\nIn 71 commits of the Finance project, not a single one caused code loss or corruption due to AI misoperation.\\n\\n**5. Real Data Validation**\\n\\nIn the Finance project, **100% of the code was generated by Claude Code**, including:\\n- 127 Java backend files (Controllers, Services, Repositories, Models)\\n- 33 Vue components (complete frontend interfaces)\\n- 25 database tables with all migration scripts and stored procedures\\n- Docker containerization configs and CI/CD workflows\\n\\n**Project Scale**:\\n- **Backend Code**: 15,748 lines (Java)\\n- **Frontend Code**: 25,131 lines (Vue/JavaScript/TypeScript, 33 components)\\n- **Database**: 25 tables, 11 migration scripts\\n- **Total Code**: Approximately 41,000 lines\\n- **Development Cycle**: November 2025 - present\\n- **Net Development Time**: Approximately 20 hours (fragmented time on weekends and evenings)\\n- **Efficiency Improvement**: Estimated 4-5x compared to traditional development\\n\\n**Decision Factors for Choosing Claude Code**:\\n- \u2705 Project requires high automation (backend + frontend + database + deployment)\\n- \u2705 I\'m comfortable with command-line operations, don\'t depend on IDE\\n- \u2705 Need programmability (Skills/Hooks) to build standardized workflows\\n- \u2705 Value security and auditability (enterprise-level requirements)\\n\\n**If you meet these criteria, I also recommend Claude Code**:\\n- Comfortable with bash/zsh and other command-line tools\\n- Project requires cross-layer operations (code + database + deployment)\\n- Hope to build reusable automated workflows\\n- Value code quality and security control\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2.5 Quick Start\\n\\n**Install Claude Code**:\\n```bash\\n# macOS/Linux\\nnpm install -g @anthropic/claude-code\\n\\n# Configure API Key\\nexport ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key\\n\\n# Launch\\nclaude\\n```\\n\\n**First Task**:\\n```bash\\nYou: Create a simple Express.js server, listen on port 3000, return Hello World\\n\\nClaude: [Generate server.js, package.json, run npm install, start server]\\n\\nYou: Visit http://localhost:3000 to verify\\n\\nClaude: [Provide test command curl http://localhost:3000]\\n```\\n\\n**Recommended Learning Path**:\\n1.

While revolutionary at the time, this was still the traditional \\"human writes code, AI assists\\" model.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nIn 2024, GitHub Copilot matured and gained widespread adoption. In the first half of 2025, with the emergence of tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and Gemini CLI, a new programming paradigm gradually took shape. By the second half of 2025, the \\"Vibe Coding\\" model matured, fundamentally changing the programming paradigm:\\n\\n- **Traditional Programming**: Developer \u2192 Write code \u2192 Compile/Test \u2192 Debug\\n- **Vibe Coding**: Developer \u2192 Describe requirements \u2192 AI generates code \u2192 Human review\\n\\nAs Martin Fowler said in his late 2025 interview:\\n> \\"AI won\'t replace programmers, but it will change the nature of programming. Future programmers will be more like \'architects + reviewers\' rather than \'code craftsmen\'.\\"\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1.2 What is Vibe Coding\\n\\n\\"Vibe Coding\\" is the community\'s colorful description of a new generation of AI-assisted programming. The core concept is:\\n\\n> **\\"Shoot and Forget\\"** - Like launching a missile, set the target and context, let AI autonomously complete the task, humans only verify the final PR.\\n\\n**Three Key Characteristics**:\\n1. **High-level Intent Expression** - Use natural language to describe \\"what to do\\" rather than \\"how to do it\\"\\n2. **Autonomous Task Execution** - AI plans steps, writes code, runs tests, submits code\\n3. **Result-focused Validation** - Humans focus on code review and final results, not the process\\n\\nThis model is fundamentally different from traditional \\"code completion\\":\\n- **Copilot Mode**: Humans write code, AI provides next-line suggestions (assistance)\\n- **Vibe Coding**: Humans provide requirements, AI completes the entire development workflow (leadership)\\n\\n**Term Origin**:\\nThe term \\"Vibe Coding\\" originated from the developer community\'s playful description of the new AI programming approach, first appearing in 2024 on Twitter/X and Reddit developer discussions. It vividly describes the new paradigm of \\"completing programming by conveying intent (vibe) rather than writing code.\\"\\n\\n**Advocates**:\\n- **Anthropic**: Provides complete CLI autonomy through Claude Code, the main driver of Vibe Coding\\n- **Cursor**: Deeply integrates AI into IDE, lowering the barrier to Vibe Coding\\n- **Replit**: AI Agent mode, users describe requirements to generate complete applications\\n\\n**Current Status** (2025):\\n- Has moved from \\"tech preview\\" to \\"production ready\\" stage\\n- Suitable for personal projects and small-to-medium teams, large enterprises still in pilot phase\\n- Mainstream tools: Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, Gemini CLI\\n- Active community, many best practices and workflows forming\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1.3 The Value of Vibe Coding\\n\\nWhy can Vibe Coding change software development efficiency?\\n\\n**1. Eliminates Repetitive Labor**\\n- Traditional: CRUD interfaces require manually writing Controller, Service, Repository, Entity, DTO...\\n- Vibe Coding: Describe requirements in one sentence, AI generates all files with consistent naming\\n\\n**2. Reduces Context Switching Costs**\\n- Traditional: Backend \u2192 Frontend \u2192 Database \u2192 Deployment, switching between multiple tech stacks\\n- Vibe Coding: AI masters full-stack technology, completes cross-layer changes in one go\\n\\n**3. Enables \\"Think-speed Programming\\"**\\n- Traditional: From idea to code takes hours or even days\\n- Vibe Coding: From idea to runnable code takes only minutes\\n\\n**Real Case** (Finance Project):\\n- Adding expense budget feature (backend API + frontend page + database script)\\n  - Traditional approach: ~4-6 hours\\n  - Vibe Coding: 45 minutes (including testing and fixes)\\n  - **Efficiency improvement: 5-8x**\\n\\n**4. Focus on \\"What\\" Rather Than \\"How\\"**\\n\\nIn the Finance project, my focus shifted from \\"writing code\\" to:\\n- **Requirement iteration and UI refinement** (35%) - New ideas naturally emerge after seeing the interface, rapid iteration\\n- **Architecture refactoring and pattern application** (30%) - While adjusting one interface, refactor similar features\\n- **Learning best practices and workflow optimization** (20%) - Explore best workflows with Claude Code, reduce wait times\\n- **Code review and quality control** (15%) - Ensure generated code meets standards\\n\\n**Real Experience**:\\n- Early on, I took many detours, wasting time waiting for AI generation and debugging\\n- As I became familiar with the tools (Skills, Hooks, CLAUDE.md), efficiency improved significantly\\n- The iteration speed of \\"see interface \u2192 generate idea \u2192 immediately implement\\" is incomparable to traditional development\\n\\nThis is what Martin Fowler meant by \\"programmers more like architects + reviewers,\\" but the actual work is more flexible\u2014a hybrid role of **architect + product manager + reviewer**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1.4 The Value of This Article\\n\\nWhile there are many introductions to AI programming tools, this article\'s unique aspects are:\\n\\n- \u2705 **Real Project Validation** - All practices come from the Finance project (GitHub: [austinxyz/finance](https://github.com/austinxyz/finance))\\n- \u2705 **100% AI Generated** - Approximately 41,000 lines of code entirely generated by Claude Code, true Vibe Coding practice\\n- \u2705 **Full Lifecycle Coverage** - Complete software engineering lifecycle from requirements analysis to production deployment\\n- \u2705 **Concrete and Actionable** - Provides actual configuration files, slash commands, skills code examples\\n- \u2705 **Theory Meets Practice** - References Martin Fowler interviews and Shrivu Shankar\'s in-depth experience\\n- \u2705 **Data-driven** - Net development time approximately 20 hours, all data verifiable\\n\\n**Finance Project Overview**:\\n- **Tech Stack**: Spring Boot 3.2 + Java 17 + Vue 3 + MySQL 8.0 + Docker\\n- **Feature Scope**: Asset management, liability tracking, expense analysis, investment management, multi-currency support, data visualization\\n- **Code Scale**: 127 Java files, 33 Vue components, 25 database tables, approximately 41,000 lines of code\\n- **Development Mode**: Completely using Claude Code, building efficient workflows through Skills, Hooks, CLAUDE.md\\n\\n**Target Audience**:\\n- Individual developers wanting to try Vibe Coding\\n- Technical managers considering introducing AI tools to teams\\n- Practitioners interested in software engineering methodology evolution\\n- Full-stack engineers looking to improve development efficiency"},{"id":"/2023/12/20/thanks-royal-flush-team","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/blog/2023/12/20/thanks-royal-flush-team","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-20-thanks-royal-flush-team.md","title":"Thanks to the Royal Flush 40+ 7.0 Team","description":"A heartfelt thanks to my Royal Flush teammates for an incredible season and national championship.","date":"2023-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"hobbies","permalink":"/blogs/blog/tags/hobbies"},{"inline":true,"label":"tennis","permalink":"/blogs/blog/tags/tennis"},{"inline":true,"label":"gratitude","permalink":"/blogs/blog/tags/gratitude"},{"inline":true,"label":"sports","permalink":"/blogs/blog/tags/sports"}],"readingTime":5.06,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Austin Xu","title":"Cloud Platform Engineering Leader @ eBay","url":"https://github.com/austinxyz","email":"austin.xyz@gmail.com","socials":{"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/austin-yanzhao-xu-6301ab6","github":"https://github.com/austinxyz"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/austinxyz.png","key":"austin","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Thanks to the Royal Flush 40+ 7.0 Team","date":"2023-12-20T00:00:00.000Z","authors":["austin"],"tags":["hobbies","tennis","gratitude","sports"],"description":"A heartfelt thanks to my Royal Flush teammates for an incredible season and national championship."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"[1/6] Claude Code: Introduction to AI-Assisted Development","permalink":"/blogs/blog/2025/12/15/claude-code-introduction"},"nextItem":{"title":"My Tennis Journey: Royal Flush Team and USTA National Championship","permalink":"/blogs/blog/2023/12/15/tennis-journey-royal-flush"}},"content":"Congratulations to the Royal Flush team for winning the 40+ 7.0M USTA Nationals Championship representing NorCal! I keep getting excited and forget to say something important - this is an amazing achievement. Everyone worked hard and contributed to the success, and you are all champions.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The Champions Who Delivered\\n\\n**Thanks to Don/Amy, Mitta, Paolo/Keri, and Bala/Judy** - you won the semifinal and final. Your performance under pressure was simply outstanding.\\n\\n**Thanks to Johnny, Tomami, Laurie, and Ross** - your wins in round robin provided a solid foundation and brought us to a great position for the semifinal and final.\\n\\n**Last, but most important, thanks to Soha** for building up such a strong team with his hard work, so we can play together to achieve such an impossible achievement!\\n\\n## Individual Spotlights\\n\\n### Don and Amy - The Dynasty Builders\\n\\nDon and Amy are really fantastic. They keep winning - from last year\'s 40+ 7.0 and 18+ 7.0 to this year\'s 40+ 7.0 national championship. I don\'t know if anyone in USTA history has such a continuous winning streak as national champions. Their consistency and excellence set the bar for all of us.\\n\\n### Mitta - The Bagel Master\\n\\nMitta performed incredibly well. Your first time playing nationals, and you just gave opponents two bagels! Then you played a key line in the Final, stayed consistent, and with a clear volley ended the match, bringing us to the championship. What a debut!\\n\\n### Paolo - The Master of Placement\\n\\nPaolo, you are the master on the match. You can play and place the ball anywhere, and the opponent can only look at the ball and sigh. Every time before a match starts, I already count it as team 1:0, so we just need to win another line. If I were your opponent, I would feel so helpless. I still remember your impossible slice drop to finish matches (consecutively in 2 matches) and your smash that brought the team our first match win in the Final.\\n\\n### Keri - Cool Under Pressure\\n\\nKeri, although you felt nervous, it didn\'t impact your performance at all. Look at your 4 matches - 3 easy wins plus the crucial first match win for the team in the Final. I saw you saving multiple impossible baseline balls and delivering lots of clear smashes. These are the solid foundation that allowed you to win 4 matches consecutively at nationals.\\n\\n### Bala and Judy - The Perfect Pair\\n\\nYou two are the perfect pair, and I should say the strongest 3.5+3.5 pairing in 7.0 mixed nationals. Starting with a bagel and winning the key match in the semifinal - the opponent had an unbeatable serve, but he felt so frustrated with Bala\'s perfect returns and Judy\'s volleys finishing at the net.\\n\\nAlthough you lost in the final, first, the opponent was the strongest pair on their team, and second, you already knew the team had won, so you were relaxed. Trust me - you can beat anyone in 7.0!\\n\\n### Johnny and Tomami - The Comeback Artists\\n\\nThank you for winning against PNW D1. You lost set 1 but quickly adjusted and won back in set 2, then won the super tiebreak as the team\'s first match win. You know I felt so helpless when all 3 lines lost the first set, and I started planning to seek the #2 team (considering we were #3) as our opponents. But your win brought me back - I got my confidence again.\\n\\nBesides that, Johnny also helped with scouting, providing so much important information about our opponents, and recorded our tears of joy for the Final win. Such a precious moment captured forever.\\n\\n### Ross and Laurie - The Mental Warriors\\n\\nYou also won another crucial match with PNW. We did a last-minute adjustment to let you play D2, and unfortunately, you faced their strongest pair. Really tough match - you lost with a close score in the first set, but you never gave up. Even when down, you turned it around and won the second set in a tiebreak, then won the super tiebreak. Such great mental skills!\\n\\nFor Laurie, I should also thank Ken. Ken took care of our nutrition and meals, letting the team just focus on playing and winning matches.\\n\\n## Our Captain and Leadership\\n\\nFinally, let me spend time thanking our great captain **Soha** and co-captain **Amy**.\\n\\nAlthough Soha wasn\'t physically with us, he always did the captain\'s work remotely - by WhatsApp chat group, by phone call, by WeChat, any tools he could leverage. He looked at all opponents\' data, collected feedback from everyone, and then made the best decisions for the lineup.\\n\\nYou may not know this is the first year Soha acted as captain to run multiple USTA teams. Right now, he has won **3 sectional championships and 1 national championship**. I cannot imagine, and I don\'t think anyone else has made such an achievement in USTA history in their first year. I forecast Soha will build his dynasty in the future for many years. Please stay close with Soha to continue this legend.\\n\\n**Amy** is another legend. As a player, together with Don, they won 3 consecutive championships. But you may not know Amy also did a lot of work on team building. She helped recruit many good players - Don, Mitta, Judy - all from her recommendations. She\'s also a role model who motivates others and shares her experience with newer national players.\\n\\nAlthough she got injured and couldn\'t play in the final, she had already built solid team members - Mitta and Judy performed perfectly, and we won the final!\\n\\n## Thank You to the Full Roster\\n\\nFinally, let me thank all team members, especially those who did not attend this national championship. Because of you, the team won all the local, playoff, and sectional matches, so we could attend nationals to represent NorCal and ultimately win the championship!\\n\\n**The whole team deserved this championship.** Without such a deep bench, we could not have reached the national championship.\\n\\nLet\'s look forward and continue our legend!\\n\\n---\\n\\n*To my Royal Flush teammates: You made this season unforgettable. Champions on the court, friends for life.*"},{"id":"/2023/12/15/tennis-journey-royal-flush","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/blog/2023/12/15/tennis-journey-royal-flush","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-15-tennis-journey-royal-flush.md","title":"My Tennis Journey: Royal Flush Team and USTA National Championship","description":"My journey from recreational player to USTA national champion with the Royal Flush team.","date":"2023-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"hobbies","permalink":"/blogs/blog/tags/hobbies"},{"inline":true,"label":"tennis","permalink":"/blogs/blog/tags/tennis"},{"inline":true,"label":"sports","permalink":"/blogs/blog/tags/sports"}],"readingTime":4.46,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Austin Xu","title":"Cloud Platform Engineering Leader @ eBay","url":"https://github.com/austinxyz","email":"austin.xyz@gmail.com","socials":{"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/austin-yanzhao-xu-6301ab6","github":"https://github.com/austinxyz"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/austinxyz.png","key":"austin","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"My Tennis Journey: Royal Flush Team and USTA National Championship","date":"2023-12-15T00:00:00.000Z","authors":["austin"],"tags":["hobbies","tennis","sports"],"description":"My journey from recreational player to USTA national champion with the Royal Flush team."},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Thanks to the Royal Flush 40+ 7.0 Team","permalink":"/blogs/blog/2023/12/20/thanks-royal-flush-team"}},"content":"Tennis has been more than just a hobby for me - it\'s been a journey of growth, friendship, and unexpected achievements. From picking up a wooden racket in high school to standing on the podium as a USTA National Champion, tennis has shaped who I am both on and off the court.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The Beginning: A Wooden Racket and No Courts\\n\\nMy tennis story started in 1990 during high school. There were no formal courts, no coach, and I played with a basic wooden racket. I was probably a 2.0 level player - absolute beginner. But something about the sport captivated me.\\n\\nDuring university (1993-2000), I continued playing recreationally about once a week. I improved to around 2.5-3.0 level through the 7 years at university. It was pure fun, nothing competitive, just enjoying the game with friends.\\n\\n## The Shanghai Years: Finding My Foundation\\n\\nAfter graduation, I joined eBay Shanghai in 2007. Tennis became part of my work-life balance - playing through company activities and the recreation club. Over those years, I progressed from 2.5 to a weak 3.5 level. But in 2014, I stopped playing, and tennis took a backseat for several years.\\n\\n## A Fresh Start in Silicon Valley\\n\\nWhen I moved to eBay\'s US headquarters in San Jose in 2017, I picked up my racket again after a 7-year break. The Bay Area tennis scene was vibrant and welcoming. In 2018, I participated in my first Chinese community tournament. In 2019, I joined USTA leagues as a 3.5 player.\\n\\nThen came the pandemic in 2020, interrupting my momentum for another half year. But when tennis resumed, I was more committed than ever.\\n\\n## The Breakthrough: 2023\\n\\n2023 was my lucky and exciting year. I became deeply involved in competitive tennis:\\n\\n**USTA Leagues:**\\n- Played 70 matches as team captain for 1 team and co-captain for 4 teams\\n- **2 National Championships, 1 National 3rd place**\\n- 3 Sectional Championships, 1 Sectional Finalist, 3 Semi-finalists\\n\\n**UTR Leagues (Chinese Community):**\\n- Individual: Hecares Gold Group doubles champion\\n- Team: Hecares Gold Group League champion, Zijing Cup Silver Group champion, SO Platinum Group Finalist\\n\\nBy this time, I had grown to a 3.5C NTRP player with 5.0 UTR in singles and 5.5 UTR in doubles. I had played over 100 USTA matches in just 3 years.\\n\\n## The Royal Flush Championship Run\\n\\nThe pinnacle came with the Royal Flush 40+ 7.0 Mixed team. Our captain Soha built an incredible team, and in his first year as captain, he achieved something remarkable - winning 3 sectional championships and 1 national championship across multiple teams.\\n\\nOur journey to nationals was intense. Every match mattered. Our lineup was perfectly balanced:\\n\\n- **Don/Amy** - The powerhouse duo who had won multiple national championships\\n- **Paolo/Keri** - Paolo\'s court mastery combined with Keri\'s solid baseline game\\n- **Bala/Judy** - The perfect 3.5+3.5 pairing with unbeatable returns and net play\\n- **Mitta/Partners** - In his first nationals, Mitta delivered bagels to opponents\\n- **Johnny/Tomami, Ross/Laurie** - Clutch wins in round robin that set our foundation\\n\\nIn the semifinals and finals, our team delivered when it mattered most. The moment we clinched the championship is something I\'ll never forget - tears, hugs, and the realization that we had achieved something truly special together.\\n\\n## What Tennis Taught Me\\n\\nBeyond the trophies and rankings, tennis has been my teacher in life:\\n\\n**Tennis Skills:** Serves, volleys, smashes, strategy - the technical aspects that keep improving.\\n\\n**Mental Toughness:** Never give up. Stay confident. Focus. Recover quickly from losses. These lessons translate directly to my work in software engineering.\\n\\n**Sportsmanship:** Integrity, fair play, empathy. Your rivals on the court become friends off the court.\\n\\n**Friendship:** I\'ve built connections across nations, cultures, ages, and genders. Some of my closest friends I met on tennis courts.\\n\\n**Leadership:** As a captain, I learned that leadership is about recruiting, analyzing opponents, setting lineups, motivating teammates, and building team unity. Most of the work happens off the court.\\n\\n## My Tennis Philosophy\\n\\nI typically play 1-2 matches and 3-4 practice sessions every week. I treat every match seriously:\\n- Good practice before matches\\n- Communication and strategy adjustments during matches\\n- Recording videos for analysis\\n- Summary and retrospection after matches\\n\\nAs a captain, I focus on recruiting good candidates, regular team practice, analyzing opponents thoroughly, and setting up optimal lineups. The team\'s success is the ultimate goal.\\n\\n## For Those Interested in Tennis\\n\\n**If you want entertainment:**\\n- Don\'t worry about your skill level\\n- Buy a decent racket (not from Costco - try Tennis Warehouse, Wilson, Head)\\n- Learn from YouTube, social media, coaches\\n- Join practice groups\\n- Practice, practice, practice\\n- Don\'t care about winning or losing initially\\n\\n**If you want competition:**\\n- Join USTA (leagues and tournaments)\\n- Join UTR (flex leagues, community events)\\n- Self-rate conservatively and start at a lower level\\n- Find a team and partner\\n- Play more matches\\n\\n## Looking Forward\\n\\nTennis has taken me from a casual player to a national champion. It\'s given me fitness, mental strength, lifelong friends, and memories I\'ll treasure forever. The Royal Flush championship was a team effort - a testament to what happens when talented people come together with a common goal.\\n\\nThe journey continues. There are more matches to play, more teams to build, more friendships to forge. Tennis helps me grow, and I\'m grateful for every moment on the court.\\n\\n*\\"Rivals on the court, friends off the court.\\"* That\'s the spirit of tennis that keeps me coming back."}]}}')}}]);
