# About Austin Xu

Hi, I'm Austin (Yanzhao Xu) — a platform engineering leader with over 20 years of experience building and operating large-scale cloud platforms.

## Professional Journey

I currently lead Cloud Platform teams at eBay, where we've migrated 5,000+ applications to Kubernetes across 100+ clusters and 2M+ pods. My work focuses on:

- **Kubernetes Infrastructure**: Building and scaling core K8s infrastructure across multiple regions
- **Application Lifecycle**: Automating deployment, scaling, and recovery for cloud-native applications
- **Developer Experience**: Creating tools and platforms that make developers more productive
- **SRE Excellence**: Applying SLO/SLI, MTTD/MTTR, and incident management best practices

Before leading the Cloud Platform team, I:
- Built eBay's multi-cloud migration platform and CI/CD automation
- Architected eBay's internal cloud platforms across three generations (VMware, OpenStack, Kubernetes)
- Led China Center of Excellence teams delivering platform tools and developer experience

## Beyond Engineering

When I'm not building platforms, you'll find me:

- **Playing Tennis**: USTA national champion, team captain, and organizer
- **Playing Pickleball**: eBay champion (2023, 2024)
- **Building Side Projects**: Created a match analysis system using SpringBoot + Vue
- **Mentoring**: Running tech/career/finance seminar series
- **Learning**: Always exploring new technologies and sharing insights

## Education

- **Master's Degree** in EE/Automation, Zhejiang University
- **Bachelor's Degree** in EE/Automation, Zhejiang University

## Connect

I'm always happy to connect with fellow engineers, leaders, and anyone interested in cloud platforms, career development, or tennis!
