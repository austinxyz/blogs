## Reading Recommendations

### For Different Audiences

**Individual Developers:**
Start with Part 1 to understand the paradigm shift, then jump to Part 3 for hands-on walkthrough. Circle back to Parts 2, 4, and 5 as you encounter specific challenges.

**Technical Managers:**
Read Parts 1, 5, and 6 to understand business value, limitations, and team adoption strategies. Skim Part 3 for technical depth.

**Students/Beginners:**
Read in order from Part 1 through Part 6. Try building small projects with Claude Code as you progress through each part.

**Experienced Engineers:**
Start with Part 4 (methodology evolution) to see how AI changes established practices, then read Part 5 (limitations) to understand boundaries. Parts 3 and 6 provide concrete implementation details.

### Reading Tips

1. **Read in Order (Recommended)**: Chapters build on each other and are best understood sequentially
2. **Practice-Oriented**: Each chapter includes real-world cases - try implementing them in your projects
3. **Critical Thinking**: Opinions are based on personal experience; adapt to your context
