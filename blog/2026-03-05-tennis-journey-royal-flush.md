Tennis has been more than just a hobby for me - it's been a journey of growth, friendship, and unexpected achievements. From picking up a wooden racket in high school to standing on the podium as a USTA National Champion, tennis has shaped who I am both on and off the court.

<!--truncate-->

## The Beginning: A Wooden Racket and No Courts

My tennis story started in 1990 during high school. There were no formal courts, no coach, and I played with a basic wooden racket. I was probably a 2.0 level player - absolute beginner. But something about the sport captivated me.

During university (1993-2000), I continued playing recreationally about once a week. I improved to around 2.5-3.0 level through the 7 years at university. It was pure fun, nothing competitive, just enjoying the game with friends.

## The Shanghai Years: Finding My Foundation

After graduation, I joined eBay Shanghai in 2007. Tennis became part of my work-life balance - playing through company activities and the recreation club. Over those years, I progressed from 2.5 to a weak 3.5 level. But in 2014, I stopped playing, and tennis took a backseat for several years.

## A Fresh Start in Silicon Valley

When I moved to eBay's US headquarters in San Jose in 2017, I picked up my racket again after a 7-year break. The Bay Area tennis scene was vibrant and welcoming. In 2018, I participated in my first Chinese community tournament. In 2019, I joined USTA leagues as a 3.5 player.

Then came the pandemic in 2020, interrupting my momentum for another half year. But when tennis resumed, I was more committed than ever.

## The Breakthrough: 2023

2023 was my lucky and exciting year. I became deeply involved in competitive tennis:

**USTA Leagues:**
- Played 70 matches as team captain for 1 team and co-captain for 4 teams
- **2 National Championships, 1 National 3rd place**
- 3 Sectional Championships, 1 Sectional Finalist, 3 Semi-finalists

**UTR Leagues (Chinese Community):**
- Individual: Hecares Gold Group doubles champion
- Team: Hecares Gold Group League champion, Zijing Cup Silver Group champion, SO Platinum Group Finalist

By this time, I had grown to a 3.5C NTRP player with 5.0 UTR in singles and 5.5 UTR in doubles. I had played over 100 USTA matches in just 3 years.

## The Royal Flush Championship Run

The pinnacle came with the Royal Flush 40+ 7.0 Mixed team. Our captain Soha built an incredible team, and in his first year as captain, he achieved something remarkable - winning 3 sectional championships and 1 national championship across multiple teams.

Our journey to nationals was intense. Every match mattered. Our lineup was perfectly balanced:

- **Don/Amy** - The powerhouse duo who had won multiple national championships
- **Paolo/Keri** - Paolo's court mastery combined with Keri's solid baseline game
- **Bala/Judy** - The perfect 3.5+3.5 pairing with unbeatable returns and net play
- **Mitta/Partners** - In his first nationals, Mitta delivered bagels to opponents
- **Johnny/Tomami, Ross/Laurie** - Clutch wins in round robin that set our foundation

In the semifinals and finals, our team delivered when it mattered most. The moment we clinched the championship is something I'll never forget - tears, hugs, and the realization that we had achieved something truly special together.

## What Tennis Taught Me

Beyond the trophies and rankings, tennis has been my teacher in life:

**Tennis Skills:** Serves, volleys, smashes, strategy - the technical aspects that keep improving.

**Mental Toughness:** Never give up. Stay confident. Focus. Recover quickly from losses. These lessons translate directly to my work in software engineering.

**Sportsmanship:** Integrity, fair play, empathy. Your rivals on the court become friends off the court.

**Friendship:** I've built connections across nations, cultures, ages, and genders. Some of my closest friends I met on tennis courts.

**Leadership:** As a captain, I learned that leadership is about recruiting, analyzing opponents, setting lineups, motivating teammates, and building team unity. Most of the work happens off the court.

## My Tennis Philosophy

I typically play 1-2 matches and 3-4 practice sessions every week. I treat every match seriously:
- Good practice before matches
- Communication and strategy adjustments during matches
- Recording videos for analysis
- Summary and retrospection after matches

As a captain, I focus on recruiting good candidates, regular team practice, analyzing opponents thoroughly, and setting up optimal lineups. The team's success is the ultimate goal.

## For Those Interested in Tennis

**If you want entertainment:**
- Don't worry about your skill level
- Buy a decent racket (not from Costco - try Tennis Warehouse, Wilson, Head)
- Learn from YouTube, social media, coaches
- Join practice groups
- Practice, practice, practice
- Don't care about winning or losing initially

**If you want competition:**
- Join USTA (leagues and tournaments)
- Join UTR (flex leagues, community events)
- Self-rate conservatively and start at a lower level
- Find a team and partner
- Play more matches

## Looking Forward

Tennis has taken me from a casual player to a national champion. It's given me fitness, mental strength, lifelong friends, and memories I'll treasure forever. The Royal Flush championship was a team effort - a testament to what happens when talented people come together with a common goal.

The journey continues. There are more matches to play, more teams to build, more friendships to forge. Tennis helps me grow, and I'm grateful for every moment on the court.

*"Rivals on the court, friends off the court."* That's the spirit of tennis that keeps me coming back.
